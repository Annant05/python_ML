# Hey Guys, I hope you all are ready for some fun assignment and I assume you have not forgotten what we have practised :D
#
# So here is the question for you all:
#
#
# A mars rover traverses in a plane from its origin point(0,0).
# The rover can only walk in 4 absolute directions -
# North(Traverses up), South(Traverses down), East (Traverses right), West(Traverses left).
# The footprints of the rover is shown as following:
#
# North 5
# South 3
# West 3
# East 2
#
# The numbers after compass directions are walked steps.
# Write a program to compute the displacement from current position after a sequence of walked path's movement and original point.
# If the distance evaluated is in float, then just print the nearest integer.
#
#
# -Sample Test case-
# If the following are steps the rover walked given as input to the program:
# North 5
# South 3
# West 3
# East 2
# Then, the output of the evaluation should be:
# 2

# TODO: Create a program with above instructions
